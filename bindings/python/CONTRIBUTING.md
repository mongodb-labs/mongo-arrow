# Contributing to PyMongoArrow

Contributions to PyMongoArrow are always encouraged. Contributions can be as simple
as minor tweaks to the documentation. Please read these guidelines
before sending a pull request.

## Bugfixes and New Features

Before starting to write code, look for existing [tickets in our JIRA project](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/ARROW)
or [create one](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/ARROW) for your specific issue or
feature request. That way you avoid working on something that might not
be of interest or that has already been addressed.

## Supported Interpreters

PyMongoArrow supports CPython 3.7+ and PyPy3.8+. Language features not
supported by all interpreters can not be used.

## Style Guide

PyMongoArrow uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for formatting and linting, with a line length of 100.

## General Guidelines

-   Avoid backward breaking changes if at all possible.
-   Write inline documentation for new classes and methods.
-   Write tests and make sure they pass (make sure you have a mongod
    running on the default port, then execute `tox -e test` from the cmd
    line to run the test suite).
-   Add yourself to doc/contributors.rst `:)`

## Authoring a Pull Request

**Our Pull Request Policy is based on this** [Code Review Developer
Guide](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review)

The expectation for any code author is to provide all the context needed
in the space of a pull request for any engineer to feel equipped to
review the code. Depending on the type of change, do your best to
highlight important new functions or objects you've introduced in the
code; think complex functions or new abstractions. Whilst it may seem
like more work for you to adjust your pull request, the reality is your
likelihood for getting a review sooner shoots up.

**Self Review Guidelines to follow**

-   If the PR is too large, split it if possible.

    - Use 250 lines of code (excluding test data and config changes) as a
            rule-of-thumb.

     - Moving and changing code should be in separate PRs or commits.

        -   Moving: Taking large code blobs and transplanting
            them to another file. There\'s generally no (or very
            little) actual code changed other than a cut and
            paste. It can even be extended to large deletions.
        -   Changing: Adding code changes (be that refactors or
            functionality additions/subtractions).
        -   These two, when mixed, can muddy understanding and
            sometimes make it harder for reviewers to keep track
            of things.

-   Prefer explaining with code comments instead of PR comments.

**Provide background**

-   The PR description and linked tickets should answer the "what" and
    "why" of the change. The code change explains the "how".

**Follow the Template**

-   Please do not deviate from the template we make; it is there for a
    lot of reasons. If it is a one line fix, we still need to have
    context on what and why it is needed.

-   If making a versioning change, please let that be known. See examples below:

    -   `versionadded:: 3.11`
    -   `versionchanged:: 3.5`

**Pull Request Template Breakdown**

-  **Github PR Title**

    -   The PR Title format should always be
        `[JIRA-ID] : Jira Title or Blurb Summary`.

-  **JIRA LINK**

    -   Convenient link to the associated JIRA ticket.

-   **Summary**

     -   Small blurb on why this is needed. The JIRA task should have
            the more in-depth description, but this should still, at a
            high level, give anyone looking an understanding of why the
            PR has been checked in.

-    **Changes in this PR**

     -   The explicit code changes that this PR is introducing. This
            should be more specific than just the task name. (Unless the
            task name is very clear).

-   **Test Plan**

    -   Everything needs a test description. Describe what you did
            to validate your changes actually worked; if you did
            nothing, then document you did not test it. Aim to make
            these steps reproducible by other engineers, specifically
            with your primary reviewer in mind.

-   **Screenshots**

    -   Any images that provide more context to the PR. Usually,
            these just coincide with the test plan.

-   **Callouts or follow-up items**

    -   This is a good place for identifying "to-dos" that you've
            placed in the code (Must have an accompanying JIRA Ticket).
    -   Potential bugs that you are unsure how to test in the code.
    -   Opinions you want to receive about your code.

# Installing from source

## System Requirements

On macOS, you need a working modern XCode installation with the XCode
Command Line Tools. Additionally, you need CMake and pkg-config:

``` bash
$ xcode-select --install
$ brew install cmake
$ brew install pkg-config
```

On Linux, installation requires gcc 12, CMake and pkg-config.

Windows is not yet supported.

## Environment Setup

First, clone the mongo-arrow git repository:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-arrow.git
$ cd mongo-arrow/bindings/python
```

Additionally, create a virtualenv in which to install `pymongoarrow`
from sources:

``` bash
$ virtualenv pymongoarrow
$ source ./pymongoarrow/bin/activate
$ pip install tox
```

### libbson

PyMongoArrow uses
[libbson](http://mongoc.org/libbson/current/index.html). Detailed
instructions for building/installing `libbson` can be found
[here](http://mongoc.org/libmongoc/1.21.0/installing.html#installing-the-mongodb-c-driver-libmongoc-and-bson-library-libbson).

You can either use a system-provided version of `libbson` that is
properly configured for use with `pkg-config`, or use the provided
`build-libbson.sh` script to build it:

``` bash
$ LIBBSON_INSTALL_DIR=$(pwd)/libbson tox -e build-libbson
```

On macOS, users can install the latest `libbson` using Homebrew:

``` bash
$ brew install mongo-c-driver
```

Conda users can install `libbson` as follows:

``` bash
$ conda install --channel conda-forge libbson pkg-config
```

The minimum required version is listed in `pymongoarrow/version.py`. If
you try to build with a lower version a `ValueError` will be raised.

## Build

Typically we will use the provided `tox` scripts and will not build
directly, but you can build and test in the created virtualenv.

In the previously created virtualenv, to install PyMongoArrow and its
test dependencies in editable mode:

``` bash
(pymongoarrow) $ pip install -v -e ".[test]"
```

If you built libbson using the `build-libbson` script then use the same
`LIBBSON_INSTALL_DIR` as above:

> (pymongoarrow) \$ LIBBSON_INSTALL_DIR=\$(pwd)/libbson pip install -v
> -e ".\[test\]"

## Test

To run the test suite, you will need a MongoDB instance running on
`localhost` using port `27017`. To run the entire test suite, do:

``` bash
(pymongoarrow) $ tox -e test
```

or, if not using `tox`:

> (pymongoarrow) \$ pytest

## Running Linters

PyMongoArrow uses [pre-commit](https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit/) for
managing linting of the codebase. `pre-commit` performs various checks
on all files in PyMongoArrow and uses tools that help follow a
consistent code style within the codebase.

To set up `pre-commit` locally, run:

``` bash
(pymongoarrow) $ pip install pre-commit
(pymongoarrow) $ pre-commi t install
```

To run `pre-commit` manually, run:

``` bash
(pymongoarrow) $ tox -e lint
```

## Running Benchmarks

### System Requirements

To run the benchmarks, you need the [asv](https://pypi.org/project/asv/)
package, which can then be invoked like so:

``` bash
asv run --strict --python=`which python`
```

or you can run with tox as:

``` bash
tox -e benchmarks
```
