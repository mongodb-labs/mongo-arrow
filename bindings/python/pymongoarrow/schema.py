    To create a schema, provide its constructor a mapping of field names
    to their expected types, e.g.::

       schema1 = Schema({'field_1': int, 'field_2': float})

    Each key in ``schema`` is a field name and its corresponding value
    is the expected type of the data contained in the named field.

    For more examples, see :ref:`schema usage`.

    Data types can be specified as pyarrow type instances (e.g.
    an instance of :class:`pyarrow.int64`), bson types (e.g.
    :class:`bson.Int64`), or python type-identifiers (e.g. ``int``,
    ``float``). To see a complete list of supported data types and their
    corresponding type-identifiers, see :ref:`type support`.
